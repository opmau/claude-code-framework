# CLAUDE.md — [Project Name]

<!-- Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD -->
<!-- Template version: 2.0 -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     AUTO-GENERATED SECTION MARKERS

     Some sections below use markers like:
       <!-- auto-generated-start:SECTION_NAME -->
       <!-- auto-generated-end:SECTION_NAME -->

     These markers enable the /retro and /create-ticket skills to
     programmatically update specific sections without disturbing the rest
     of the file. Do NOT remove or rename these markers.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

This file provides **mandatory rules** for Claude Code when working on [Project Name].

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

     1. Replace all [BRACKETED] placeholders with your project values
     2. Delete sections that don't apply (e.g., Production Protection if no prod env)
     3. Delete this comment block when done
     4. Keep the file under 300 lines — link to external docs for details
     5. Move sprint/phase progress to docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md (separate template)

     WHAT BELONGS HERE:
     ✅ Permanent rules that apply to every session
     ✅ Architecture decisions and their rationale
     ✅ Build/test commands (the ones Claude runs most often)
     ✅ Domain knowledge that's easy to get wrong
     ✅ Agent behavior constraints

     WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE:
     ❌ Sprint/task progress (use CURRENT_SPRINT.md)
     ❌ Full API documentation (link to docs/ instead)
     ❌ Code examples longer than ~10 lines (link to source files)
     ❌ Rules that only apply during a specific phase
     ❌ Changelogs or history
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Framework Rules (DO NOT MODIFY)

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     This section protects the template's structure from being eroded
     over time. Claude may suggest removing "unnecessary" rules — resist
     this. The rules exist because of real failures in real projects.

     DELETE THIS COMMENT BLOCK after initial setup, but keep the rules.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

This CLAUDE.md follows a **battle-tested framework**. These meta-rules govern the file itself:

### What Claude May Change
- ✅ Replace `[BRACKETED]` placeholders with project-specific values
- ✅ Delete entire sections marked as optional that don't apply to this project
- ✅ Add entries to Domain Knowledge & Gotchas as they're discovered
- ✅ Update build/test commands when they change
- ✅ Update the directory structure when files are added/moved
- ✅ Propose new entries to the test mapping table

### What Claude May NOT Change (Without User Approval)
- ❌ Remove or weaken any Agent Behavior Rule (especially anti-sycophancy rules)
- ❌ Remove or weaken the Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement section
- ❌ Remove or weaken the Scope of Change Guardrails
- ❌ Reorder sections (the order is deliberate — most-used first)
- ❌ Merge sections together ("for brevity")
- ❌ Rewrite rules in different words that dilute their meaning
- ❌ Add large new sections without user discussion first
- ❌ Remove file size limits or increase them beyond the calibration table
- ❌ Remove the "Max Fix Attempts" or "Evidence-Based Claims" rules
- ❌ Simplify the splitting strategies or change size limit tables

### Why These Rules Exist

Every rule in this file was added because of a **real failure**:

| Rule | What Went Wrong Without It |
|------|---------------------------|
| File size limits | 2900-line file consumed entire context window, Claude hallucinated |
| Anti-sycophancy | Claude agreed with a wrong fix that caused financial losses |
| Evidence-based claims | Claude claimed code existed that didn't, wasting hours debugging |
| Max 2 fix attempts | Claude made 5 failed fix attempts, each introducing new bugs |
| Scope guardrails | Asked to fix 1 bug, Claude refactored 8 files and broke 3 things |
| Feedback loop | Same gotcha was rediscovered 4 times across sessions |
| Document, don't fix | Bug fix during refactor caused untraceable regression |

**If Claude suggests removing a rule, it should explain what replaces the protection that rule provides.**

## Project Overview

<!-- auto-generated-start:overview -->
- **What:** [One sentence — e.g., "Broker plugin connecting Zorro to Hyperliquid exchange"]
- **Language:** [e.g., C++14, TypeScript, Python 3.11]
- **Build system:** [e.g., CMake + MSVC 2022, npm, cargo]
- **Key dependencies:** [e.g., secp256k1, WinHTTP, React 18]
- **Entry point:** [e.g., `src/api/hl_broker.cpp`, `src/index.ts`]
<!-- auto-generated-end:overview -->

<!-- auto-generated-start:commands -->
| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Build | `[your build command]` |
| Test (all) | `[your test-all command]` |
| Test (quick) | `[your fast-test command]` |
| Lint | `[your lint command]` |
<!-- auto-generated-end:commands -->

**Related docs:**
- `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` — Active work, phase checklists, current branch
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — Bugs to fix (not during refactoring)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Visual diagrams, design decisions

<!-- TIP: Put the build/test commands at the top because Claude needs them
     almost every session. Don't make it scroll past architecture diagrams
     to find "how do I compile this?" -->

---

## Architecture

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS (for Claude Code):

     Without explicit layer rules, Claude will take the shortest path to
     make code work — often adding a reverse dependency (e.g., importing a
     service inside a utility module) that creates coupling. Claude doesn't
     "feel" architectural pain the way a human does over weeks of
     maintenance. These rules substitute for that intuition.

     The layer diagram also helps Claude decide WHERE to put new code.
     Without it, new functions tend to land in whichever file Claude has
     open, regardless of where they logically belong.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Layers

<!-- Replace this with your project's architecture. The key value is making
     the DEPENDENCY DIRECTION explicit so Claude doesn't create circular deps.

     You don't need exactly 4 layers. 2-5 is typical. The critical thing is
     that the direction is ONE-WAY and Claude knows which files belong where. -->

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 4 — API / Entry Point                    │
│  [files that expose the public interface]        │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 3 — Services / Business Logic            │
│  [files that coordinate lower layers]            │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 2 — Transport / Infrastructure           │
│  [HTTP clients, DB access, message queues]       │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1 — Foundation                           │
│  [Types, config, utilities — no upper deps]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dependency Rules

```
ALLOWED:     Foundation → Transport → Services → API
             (lower layers may be used by higher layers)

FORBIDDEN:   ❌ Any reverse dependency (lower importing higher)
             ❌ Circular dependencies between any modules
             ❌ Foundation knowing about Transport/Service types
```

**Before adding an import/include, verify it doesn't violate layer rules.**

### Where to Put New Code

<!-- This decision tree prevents Claude from dumping everything into one file -->

| If the new code... | It belongs in... | Example |
|--------------------|------------------|---------|
| Defines types/interfaces shared everywhere | Foundation | `types.h`, `models.ts` |
| Makes network calls or does I/O | Transport | `http_client.cpp`, `db.ts` |
| Contains business rules or orchestration | Services | `order_service.cpp` |
| Adapts services to an external interface | API | `broker.cpp`, `routes.ts` |
| Doesn't fit any layer | **Ask the user** | Don't guess |

### Naming Conventions

<!-- Adapt prefixes to your project. The point is consistency so Claude
     can infer the layer from the filename alone. -->

| Prefix/Pattern | Layer | Example |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| `[prefix]_` | Foundation | `[prefix]_types.h`, `[prefix]_config.ts` |
| `[other]_` | Transport | `[other]_connection.h` |

<!-- Add namespace/module conventions if applicable -->

---

## File Size Limits

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS (for Claude Code):

     This is NOT just a code quality rule — it's an AGENT PERFORMANCE rule.

     1. CONTEXT WINDOW: Claude reads entire files before editing. A 2000-line
        file consumes ~40% of context, leaving little room for reasoning.
        Smaller files = more room for Claude to think.

     2. EDIT ACCURACY: Claude's Edit tool uses string matching. In a large
        file, the same pattern might appear multiple times, causing the edit
        to target the wrong location. Smaller files = fewer ambiguous matches.

     3. SCOPE OF DAMAGE: If Claude makes a mistake in a 200-line file, the
        blast radius is small. In a 2000-line file, a bad edit can cascade.

     4. SESSION EFFICIENCY: With small modules, Claude can /clear context
        between modules during large refactors, preventing hallucination
        from context exhaustion.

     CALIBRATING FOR YOUR LANGUAGE:
     The numbers below assume C++/TypeScript. Adjust for your language:

     | Language   | Header/Interface | Implementation | Total |
     |------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
     | C/C++      | 150              | 400            | 500   |
     | TypeScript | 100              | 300            | 400   |
     | Python     | N/A              | 300            | 300   |
     | Rust       | N/A              | 400            | 400   |
     | Go         | N/A              | 400            | 400   |

     Python and Go tend toward shorter files because of conventions.
     C++ headers have less logic so they can be slightly larger.

     These are guidelines, not laws — a 410-line file is fine. A 900-line
     file means something went wrong architecturally.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

| Type | Limit | Action if Exceeded |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Header / interface files | [150] lines | Split into sub-modules |
| Implementation files | [400] lines | Split into sub-modules |
| Total per module (header + impl) | [500] lines | Split or refactor |

**If you're about to create a file exceeding these limits, STOP and discuss splitting strategy.**

### Splitting Strategies

<!-- Give Claude concrete patterns so it knows HOW to split, not just WHEN -->

| Situation | Strategy | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| File has multiple unrelated responsibilities | Extract by responsibility | `user_service.cpp` → `user_auth.cpp` + `user_profile.cpp` |
| File has one responsibility but lots of code | Extract helpers/utilities | `parser.cpp` → `parser.cpp` + `parser_helpers.cpp` |
| Header has too many declarations | Split public vs internal | `module.h` (public API) + `module_internal.h` (impl details) |
| Test file is too long | Split by feature under test | `test_user.cpp` → `test_user_auth.cpp` + `test_user_profile.cpp` |

---

## Scope of Change Guardrails

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS (for Claude Code):

     Claude's biggest failure mode isn't writing bad code — it's writing
     CORRECT code in the WRONG scope. Asked to fix a bug in file A, Claude
     might "helpfully" refactor files B, C, and D at the same time. These
     rules keep changes contained and reviewable.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Single-Responsibility Changes

- Each commit should address **one concern** (one bug, one feature, one refactor)
- If you discover a second problem while fixing the first, **document it** in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and address it in a separate session
- Do NOT "improve" code that you're reading for context — only modify files you were asked to modify

### Pre-Change Checklist

Before modifying any file, Claude should verify:

1. **Is this file in scope?** Does the user's request require changing this file?
2. **Is this the right layer?** Does the change belong at this architectural level?
3. **Will this break callers?** If changing a function signature, who calls it?
4. **Is there a test for this?** If yes, run it after. If no, consider adding one.

### Change Size Limits

<!-- These prevent Claude from making sweeping changes that are hard to review -->

| Change Type | Max Files | If Exceeded |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Bug fix | 1-3 files | Ask if scope is correct |
| Feature addition | 3-5 files | Present plan before coding |
| Refactor | 5-10 files | Must have a plan approved by user |
| Architecture change | Any | ALWAYS present plan first, get approval |

---

## Testing Protocol

### When to Run Tests

<!-- This is the highest-value section for preventing regressions.
     Map modified code areas to specific test suites. -->

| If you modify... | Run this test | Why |
|------------------|---------------|-----|
| [critical area 1] | `[specific test command]` | [consequence of regression] |
| [critical area 2] | `[specific test command]` | [consequence of regression] |
| Any code | `[full test suite command]` | Runs all regression tests |

### Critical Invariants

<!-- Document formulas, business rules, or constants that tests validate.
     If someone changes these without updating tests, the test MUST fail. -->

```
[Document key formulas, constants, or business rules here]
[Example:]
[  TAX_RATE = price * 0.0825  — validated by test_tax_calculation]
[  RETRY_LIMIT = 3            — validated by test_retry_logic]
```

### Pre-Commit Hook

<!-- Optional but recommended -->

```bash
# Install once:
[your hook install command]

# After installation, `git commit` will be blocked if tests fail.
```

---

## Agent Behavior Rules

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     These rules govern HOW Claude works, not WHAT it builds.
     They're universal across projects — keep them all.

     The anti-sycophancy rules are particularly important. Claude's default
     behavior is to agree with the user and avoid conflict. In engineering,
     this creates dangerous blind spots. These rules override that default.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Critical Thinking & Constructive Pushback

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     WHY THIS EXISTS:

     Claude's default is to be agreeable. In a coding context, this means:
     - User says "let's add a cache here" → Claude adds a cache (even if
       the real problem is a missing index)
     - User says "this approach is fine" → Claude agrees (even if it sees
       a race condition)
     - User proposes a quick fix → Claude implements it (even if the root
       cause is elsewhere)

     This section makes Claude a rigorous engineering partner, not a
     compliant assistant.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

**Claude MUST act as a critical engineering partner, not a yes-machine.**

When the user proposes a solution or makes a technical claim:

1. **EVALUATE independently** — check docs, source code, and your own reasoning before responding
2. **If you disagree, SAY SO** — state your concern with evidence. Use the phrase: *"I'd push back on this because..."*
3. **If you see a better approach, PROPOSE IT** — even if the user didn't ask. Use: *"Have you considered [X]? It would [benefit] because [reason]."*
4. **If you're uncertain, SAY THAT** — *"I'm not confident about this because..."* is better than silent agreement
5. **NEVER agree just to be agreeable** — a wrong answer delivered politely is still wrong

| Situation | ❌ Sycophantic Response | ✅ Engineering Response |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| User proposes a fix | "Great idea, let me implement that" | "That would fix the symptom, but I think the root cause is [X] because [evidence]. Should we fix that instead?" |
| User's approach works but has tradeoffs | "Sounds good!" | "This works, but it introduces [tradeoff]. An alternative is [Y]. Which tradeoff do you prefer?" |
| User asks "does this look right?" | "Yes, looks good!" | "Line 42 has [issue]. Also, this doesn't handle the case where [edge case]. Otherwise the approach is solid." |
| User challenges Claude's suggestion | "You're right, sorry" | "Let me re-check... [checks docs/code]. Actually, [the docs say X / the code shows Y]. Here's why I still think [or: you're right because]..." |

### Proactive Code Review

When reading code (even code you didn't write and weren't asked to review):

- **Flag potential bugs** — don't wait to be asked
- **Question assumptions** — "This assumes X is always positive — is that guaranteed?"
- **Identify missing edge cases** — "What happens when the list is empty?"
- **Note technical debt** — "This works but couples [A] to [B], which will make [future change] harder"

Present concerns using this format:
```
⚠️ CONCERN: [one-line summary]
   Evidence: [file:line or reasoning]
   Risk: [what could go wrong]
   Suggestion: [what to do about it]
```

### Evidence-Based Claims

Before claiming "X is implemented" or "the code does Y":

1. **FIND** the actual code with grep/search
2. **QUOTE** relevant lines with file:line references
3. **VERIFY** it does what you claim

| | Example |
|---|---------|
| ✅ Good | "`PriceCache::setBidAsk` at `ws_price_cache.cpp:45` updates timestamp" |
| ❌ Bad | "The cache updates timestamps" (no evidence) |

### Max Fix Attempts

If the **2nd** fix attempt fails:

1. **STOP** — do not attempt a 3rd fix
2. **SUMMARIZE** what was tried and why it failed
3. **STATE** what you think the actual root cause is (it may not be what you initially assumed)
4. **ASK** for guidance — suggest next diagnostic steps, don't just say "I'm stuck"
5. **DOCUMENT** in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` if appropriate

<!-- Adjust the attempt count per project. 2 is good for most. -->

### Debugging Protocol

Before proposing ANY fix:

1. **Read the FULL log** — not just first/last 100 lines
2. **Quote the EXACT error** with line numbers
3. **Identify the layer** — which architectural layer is the error in?
4. **Check documentation** in `[your docs folder]`
5. **State assumptions** explicitly — what do you THINK is true vs what you've VERIFIED?
6. **Propose fix WITH reasoning** — *"I believe the fix is [X] because [Y], which I verified by [Z]"*
7. **State what could go wrong** — *"This fix assumes [A]. If [A] is wrong, this will [consequence]"*

---

## Bug Handling Policy

<!-- Phase-dependent: choose which mode is active -->

### During Refactoring / Major Migration

When you encounter a bug during extraction or migration:

1. **DO NOT FIX IT** in the same session
2. **DOCUMENT IT** in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` using the template there
3. **CONTINUE** with extraction
4. **FIX LATER** after the migration is complete

**Rationale:** Mixing refactoring with bug fixes leads to untraceable changes and harder rollbacks.

### During Normal Development

1. If a bug **blocks** your current task → fix it, document the fix in the commit message
2. If a bug is **unrelated** to your current task → document in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, finish current work first
3. If a test fails → document in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, do NOT attempt on-the-fly fixes (they often introduce new bugs)

---

## Production Protection

<!-- Delete this section if your project has no production environment.
     Adjust severity language to match actual risk. -->

**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY. VIOLATION CAN CAUSE [real financial losses / data loss / service outage / etc.].**

### Branch Strategy

| Branch | Artifact | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `main` | [Production artifact] | PRODUCTION — protected |
| `dev` | [Dev artifact] | TESTING — safe to experiment |
| `feature/*` | N/A | Feature development |

### Merge Workflow

1. Feature branch → PR to `dev` (CI must pass)
2. Test on `dev` with [dev artifact]
3. `dev` → PR to `main` (requires explicit user approval)
4. **NEVER** force-push to `main` or `dev`

### Before ANY Production Change

1. Full test suite passes
2. Tested on `dev` branch
3. **User explicitly approves** in chat
4. Only then merge to `main`

---

## Code Style & Conventions

### File Header Template

<!-- Adapt to your language. The key metadata: filename, layer, deps, thread safety. -->

```[language]
//=============================================================================
// [filename] - [one-line description]
//=============================================================================
// Part of [Project Name]
//
// LAYER: [Foundation | Transport | Service | API]
// DEPENDENCIES: [list imports/includes this needs]
// THREAD SAFETY: [All public methods thread-safe | Not thread-safe | N/A]
//=============================================================================
```

### Commit Message Format

<!-- Use conventional commits or your project's convention -->

```
refactor: extract <module>
feat: add <feature description>
fix: <module> - <description>
test: add <module> unit tests
docs: update <document>
```

---

## Domain Knowledge & Gotchas

<!-- This is your highest-value-per-token section. Encode hard-won lessons
     that would take Claude (or a human) hours to rediscover.

     Use this consistent template for each gotcha: -->

<!-- auto-generated-start:gotchas -->
### [Pattern / Gotcha Name]

- **Context:** [When does this matter?]
- **Rule:** [What must you always do?]
- **Why:** [What goes wrong otherwise?]
- **Example:**
  ```[language]
  // Correct usage
  [code snippet]
  ```

<!-- Example categories to populate:
     ### Threading Patterns
     ### Data Format Quirks
     ### External System Constraints
     ### Common Mistake Patterns
     ### API Idiosyncrasies
-->
<!-- auto-generated-end:gotchas -->

---

## Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     WHY THIS EXISTS:

     Most CLAUDE.md files are static — written once, stale within weeks.
     This section makes the engineering process SELF-IMPROVING by building
     feedback loops into normal workflow. Claude should actively maintain
     these docs, not just follow them.

     This is how you avoid the pattern of making the same mistake twice.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Post-Session Review

At the end of each significant work session (not trivial one-liners), Claude should:

1. **What went well?** — Did the approach work on first try? Note it.
2. **What went wrong?** — Did a fix fail? Did tests catch something? Document the root cause.
3. **What was surprising?** — Did you discover something about the codebase that isn't documented?
4. **Should CLAUDE.md be updated?** — If you hit a gotcha that isn't in Domain Knowledge, **propose adding it.**

### Living Documentation Rule

These project docs are **living documents**. Claude should proactively suggest updates when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| A gotcha was discovered that's not in Domain Knowledge | Propose adding it to CLAUDE.md |
| A build/test command changed | Update Project Overview table |
| A new file doesn't fit the directory structure | Propose updating the structure |
| An architecture decision was made | Propose adding to Architecture section |
| A bug was fixed | Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md with fix details |
| A rule in CLAUDE.md was wrong or unhelpful | **Say so** — propose removing or changing it |

**Claude should suggest doc updates, not silently comply with stale rules.**

### Retrospective Triggers

After these events, Claude should prompt a brief retrospective:

- **A bug that tests didn't catch** → "Should we add a test for this? Should the test mapping table be updated?"
- **A fix that took >2 attempts** → "What made this hard? Is there a missing diagnostic or a misleading doc?"
- **A refactor that touched >5 files** → "Was the architecture section accurate? Did dependency rules hold?"
- **A production incident** → "What's the post-mortem? What do we add to Domain Knowledge to prevent recurrence?"

### Improvement Tracking

<!-- Optional: track meta-improvements to the process itself -->

When a process improvement is identified, add it to `docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md`:

```markdown
### Process Improvements Backlog
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook for [X]
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md Domain Knowledge with [gotcha]
- [ ] Add test coverage for [area that bit us]
- [ ] Clarify architecture rule about [ambiguous case]
```

## Claude Code Capabilities

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     This section documents what Claude Code features are active and where
     to find them. It serves as an inventory so Claude (and the user)
     knows what automation is in place.

     The actual configurations live in .claude/ — this section just
     documents what's set up and why.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Skills (Slash Commands)

Custom slash commands available in this project:

| Command | What It Does | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `/build` | Compile and report pass/fail | `.claude/skills/build/SKILL.md` |
| `/test` | Run tests, parse output, report results | `.claude/skills/test/SKILL.md` |
| `/review` | Pre-commit code review against CLAUDE.md | `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` |
| `/check-sizes` | Audit all source files against size limits | `.claude/skills/check-sizes/SKILL.md` |
| `/retro` | Post-session retrospective and doc updates | `.claude/skills/retro/SKILL.md` |
| `/commit` | Generate conventional commit from staged changes | `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` |
| `/create-pr` | Create PR with structured description | `.claude/skills/create-pr/SKILL.md` |
| `/create-ticket` | Create a tracked ticket for task management | `.claude/skills/create-ticket/SKILL.md` |
| `/create-skill` | Generate a new skill from a description | `.claude/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md` |

<!-- Add project-specific skills as needed. Use /create-skill to generate
     new skills following the framework's conventions. Skills save context by
     encapsulating repetitive workflows into one-keystroke commands. -->

### Hooks (Automated Enforcement)

These hooks enforce rules automatically — Claude doesn't need to remember them:

| Event | What It Does | Config |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `PostToolUse` (Edit/Write) | Warns if file exceeds size limits | `.claude/hooks/check-file-size.sh` |
| `PreToolUse` (Edit/Write) | Warns if editing out-of-scope files | `.claude/hooks/check-scope.sh` |
| `PreCompact` | Re-injects critical rules before context compression | `.claude/hooks/inject-critical-rules.sh` |
| `Stop` | Periodic reminder to check for doc updates | `.claude/hooks/session-check.sh` |

Hook configuration is in `.claude/settings.local.json` under the `"hooks"` key.

### Modular Rules

Rules files in `.claude/rules/` are auto-loaded every session:

| File | Scope | What It Covers |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `agent-behavior.md` | All files | Anti-sycophancy, evidence rule, max fix attempts |
| `scope-guardrails.md` | All files | Single-responsibility, pre-change checklist |
| `file-size-limits.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | Size limits and splitting strategies |
| `testing-protocol.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | Test mapping, bug handling |
| `feedback-loop.md` | All files | Post-session review, living docs |

<!-- Rules files supplement CLAUDE.md. They're loaded automatically and
     can be path-scoped so they only apply to relevant files. -->

### Agents

Custom subagents for specialized tasks:

| Agent | Model | Memory | When to Use |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `code-reviewer` | Haiku | Project | Before commits — reviews against CLAUDE.md |
| `planner` | Sonnet | Project | Before multi-step features, refactors, or architecture changes |
| `qa-tester` | Sonnet | Project | Writing tests, validating coverage, investigating failures |
| `[domain]-expert` | Opus | Project | After 2 failed fix attempts on [domain] issues |

Agent memory persists in `.claude/agent-memory/[agent-name]/MEMORY.md` and is automatically included in the agent's context on each invocation.

### Ticket System

Task tracking that persists across sessions. See `.claude/tickets/README.md` for full details.

- **Index:** `.claude/tickets/ticket-list.md`
- **Template:** `.claude/tickets/TICKET-000-template.md`
- **Create new:** Use `/create-ticket` or manually copy the template
- **Statuses:** 🔴 Todo → 🟡 In Progress → 🟢 Done (also 🔵 Blocked, ⚫ Cancelled)

## User Prompts for Steering Claude

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     This section is FOR THE USER, not for Claude. It provides copy-paste
     phrases that effectively steer Claude's behavior. Think of these as
     a "remote control" for the agent.

     Keep this section — it's the most practical part of the template
     for someone who's never used CLAUDE.md before.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

### Keeping Claude Focused

Use these phrases when Claude is drifting off-task or being too broad:

| Phrase | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| *"Only modify [file]. Don't touch anything else."* | Claude is editing files outside scope |
| *"What's your plan before you start coding?"* | Force Claude to think before acting |
| *"Stop. What exactly are you trying to solve?"* | Claude is fixing symptoms, not root cause |
| *"List the files you're going to change and why."* | Pre-flight check before large changes |
| *"Don't refactor — just fix the bug."* | Claude is gold-plating |
| *"What are the risks of this change?"* | Force Claude to think about consequences |

### Demanding Rigor

Use these phrases to get higher-quality engineering output:

| Phrase | What It Triggers |
|--------|-----------------|
| *"What's the evidence for that claim?"* | Forces Claude to cite code, not guess |
| *"What are the tradeoffs of this approach?"* | Forces balanced analysis, not one-sided advocacy |
| *"What could go wrong with this fix?"* | Forces failure mode analysis |
| *"What are you assuming that you haven't verified?"* | Surfaces hidden assumptions |
| *"Is there a simpler way to do this?"* | Prevents over-engineering |
| *"How would you test this?"* | Forces testability thinking |

### Triggering Pushback

Use these phrases when you WANT Claude to challenge you:

| Phrase | What It Triggers |
|--------|-----------------|
| *"Challenge this approach — what am I missing?"* | Explicit permission to disagree |
| *"Play devil's advocate on this design."* | Role-based disagreement |
| *"What would a senior engineer say about this?"* | Third-person perspective shift |
| *"I think we should [X]. Convince me I'm wrong."* | Forces counter-argument |
| *"Rate this approach 1-10 and explain the gaps."* | Quantitative assessment |
| *"What would you do differently if this were your project?"* | Removes deference |

### Session Management

| Phrase | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| *"/clear"* | Reset context between modules during long refactors |
| *"Summarize what we've done and what's left."* | Checkpoint before context fills up |
| *"What should we update in CLAUDE.md based on today?"* | Trigger the feedback loop |
| *"Before you commit, run through the pre-change checklist."* | Enforce guardrails |

## Session Workflow

<!-- How Claude should approach each work session -->

```
1. State context and task
2. List files in scope (read before modifying)
3. Create/modify files
4. Verify build: [build command]
5. Run relevant tests: [test command]
6. Post-session: any CLAUDE.md or KNOWN_ISSUES updates needed?
7. git commit (if requested)
8. /clear to reset context (for long refactors)
```
